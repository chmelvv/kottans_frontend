# Task 0 (get familiar with Git and GitHub):
* ~~Finish the course How to use Git and GitHub~~ 
* ~~Finish try.github.io~~
* ~~Create repository named "kottans_frontend"~~
* ~~Create README.md for the repository~~
* ~~Describe your impressions about learned materials~~

First 2 tasks done before (I used git about 4 years).
Impression about git - OK, better in everyday tasks than Subversion (yes, in some companies it is still using).
